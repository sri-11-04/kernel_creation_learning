🧩 Task 2: Structs + Manual Copy
Goal: Reconnect with layout and ownership.

Requirements:

Define a struct Student

Dynamically allocate one

Write your own copy_student() without memcpy

Free everything correctly

What this refreshes:

Struct access

Deep vs shallow copy

Memory lifetime



Note: from the chat gpt...
    memcpy is shallow copy only because byte by byte will copy the heap not the heap value,
    if we want to handle the ownership we need to use our logic for deepcopy.

    a pointers size is 8 bytes no matter what the type is, in 64bit sys it will be 8 bytes and in 32bits it will be 4 bytes.

    also some mini things like we cannot assign a heap memory a direct value like char *name = "helo"; we should copy the value from the static "helo" to heap 'name'

    (void*)0 == NULL (as NULL is a MACRO fro (void *)0)

    memcpy and memmove are dif in handling the overlaping byte (memmove handle that)
